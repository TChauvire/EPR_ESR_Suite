Denoising scripts for distance distribution (4P-DEER ...) analysis.

This set of packages was initially written under Matlab by Maddhur Srivastava
(ms2736@cornell.edu). It was then adapted by Chris Myer, staff at
CAC at Cornell (http://www.cac.cornell.edu/).
So the original software working with a Bokh graphical user interface is found
at https://github.com/CornellCAC/denoising.
And you may want the access to the orginal more advanced software hosted at
this address : https://denoising.cornell.edu/

For more information about the techniques, check the different paper from
the litterature:
    - Madhur Srivastava, Elka R. Georgieva, and Jack H. Freed
    (dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpca.7b00183)

    Multilevel 1D Discrete Wavelet Transform of data.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data: array_like
        Input data
    wavelet : Wavelet object or name string
        Wavelet to use
    mode : str, optional
        Signal extension mode, see :ref:`Modes <ref-modes>`.
    level : int, optional
        Decomposition level (must be >= 0). If level is None (default) then it
        will be calculated using the ``dwt_max_level`` function.
    axis: int, optional
        Axis over which to compute the DWT. If not given, the
        last axis is used.

    Returns
    -------
    [cA_n, cD_n, cD_n-1, ..., cD2, cD1] : list
        Ordered list of coefficients arrays
        where ``n`` denotes the level of decomposition. The first element
        (``cA_n``) of the result is approximation coefficients array and the
        following elements (``cD_n`` - ``cD_1``) are details coefficients
        arrays.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from pywt import wavedec
    >>> coeffs = wavedec([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8], 'db1', level=2)
    >>> cA2, cD2, cD1 = coeffs
    >>> cD1
    array([-0.70710678, -0.70710678, -0.70710678, -0.70710678])
    >>> cD2
    array([-2., -2.])
    >>> cA2
