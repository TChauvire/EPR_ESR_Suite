    "# To-Do-List Suite for analyzing data from an EPR experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1) Advertisement and doumentation\n",
    "  \n",
    "  * Creation of an EPR Gihub webpage (https://github.com/TChauvire/EPR_ESR_Suite)\n",
    "  * Documentation of the suite program\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2) Base functions: \n",
    "**The Idea here is to test existing program to optimize the future software.\n",
    "In a first option, a GUI software will be avoided as it can time consming to design...**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * import files python 2D/3D, stacked plot\n",
    "  * Class definition: Data, data.smooth, data.fft for 2D/3D type of data and data.param\n",
    "  * Fonction plot ??? (Axes, and styles)\n",
    "  * Peak detection + FWHM measurement\n",
    "  * Function export for preformatting for origin, text ascii type or other format\n",
    "  * Function to export figure --> check vectoriel type of export\n",
    "  * Function smooth, normalize, denoising --> contact Madhur for this last part\n",
    "  * Interface to interact with MATLAB and especially easyspin\n",
    "  * Fourier transform Suite (Background subtraction, Windowing, zerofilling, fftshift) and application to 3P-ESEEM\n",
    "  * Phase transformation to a first order\n",
    "  * Fitting method: Gaussian peak, Lorenzian peak, TM, T1, ... ?\n",
    "  * RMSE calculations --> check for some existing statistic tools and library\n",
    "  * Export fitting parameters method\n",
    "  * Error functions\n",
    "  * Test function to evaluate bug in the Suite\n",
    "\n",
    "**If everything is ready, implementation of some GUI type of software will be achieved.\n",
    "--> Check for already implemeted tools...**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3) Existing software or tools in Github\n",
    "\n",
    "  * [PySpec Suite from John Franck Lab (Syracuse University)](https://jmfrancklab.github.io/)\n",
    "    [GitHub Link here](https://github.com/jmfrancklab/pyspecdata)\n",
    "    [Documentation here](https://jmfrancklab.github.io/pyspecdata/index.html)\n",
    "       1) Pros : seems to be a very elaborated library of function adapted to EPR and ODNP (Overhauser Dynamic Nuclear Polarization NMR) experiments, but also for preformatting scientific report. \n",
    "       2) Cons : some scripts seems to be written in Python 2.7 b) the software is still in development.\n",
